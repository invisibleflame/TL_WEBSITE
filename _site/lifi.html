                <p>The talk started with understanding of the differences between visible light communications (VLC) and LiFi. This followed by the introduction of the key building blocks required to create full LiFi networks. Prof. Haas reported recent key achievements with respect to component and demonstrator developments underpinning LiFi attocellular networks. He provided modelling results of such networks and address numerous misconceptions such as “LiFi is a line-of-sight technology”. The talk also addressed the issue of energy efficiency of optical attocell networks and showcases how off-the-shelf solar panels can fulfil two functions at the same time:

energy harvesting and
LiFi data detection. According to Prof Haas, in the future every LED lightbulb could be used as an ultra-fast alternative to Wi-Fi i.e. the current infrastructure is suitable for the integration of Li-Fi. He enthusiastically discussed the technological know how’s of Lifi with not only IIT Bombay students but also with students of other IIT’s through video conferencing. The talk concluded by summarising commercialisation challenges.

<h3><b>About the Speaker:</b></h3>
<p>Professor Haas received his PhD degree from the University of Edinburgh in 2001. He
currently holds the Chair of Mobile Communications at the University of Edinburgh,
and is the co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer of pureLiFi Ltd as well as the
Director of the LiFi Research and Development Center at the University of Edinburgh.
His main research interests are in optical wireless communications, hybrid optical
wireless and RF communications, spatial modulation, and interference coordination
in wireless networks. He first introduced and coined spatial modulation and LiFi. LiFi
was listed among the 50 best inventions in TIME Magazine 2011.</p>
