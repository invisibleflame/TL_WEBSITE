<p>Typical sensor nodes in Internet of Things deployments are low power, wireless, distributed over a large area, and most certainly resource constrained (usually driven off of a very low cost controller). They may contain a variety of sensors from different manufacturers, possibly using different protocols, and they are prone to failure. But sensors need to be self-organizing, self-healing, robust, cross- platform, standards-based, and secure. Addressing the challenges of a sensor network requires different solutions. Resource constraints require software optimization, power consumption requires power management, environmental issues like RF interference, require techniques such as frequency hopping, network robustness requires multiple data paths for each sensor (mesh networking) and to ensure reliability of data, advanced data collection and validation is a must. Data coming off of sensors can be hard to understand, so that data needs to be structured. And because it may be a large volume of data, at least in aggregate, processing speed and cost of the WAN and storage are critical.

The IoT controller can create order from the chaos – maintaining a data model for sensors, validating the accuracy of that data, and organizing and structuring that data. Also, using rules-based aggregation and compression, applied as policies at the controller, can reduce bandwidth Requirements. In terms of security, IoT networks with the proper management and control can exclude rogue sensors from joining the network, throttle sensor data volume, and handle firmware upgrades.

The controllers function as management gateways for sensor nodes, enforce local security policy, can be managed via existing standards, configure sensor network topology (star vs mesh) and provide logs and alarms.
